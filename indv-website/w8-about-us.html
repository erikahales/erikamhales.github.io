<p id="paragraph">I’ve always had a secret love for planning weddings so I decided to just make a website for it. So, my website will have the main theme of “All Things Wedding” but also have different pages that will zoom in to more specific details. The thing that makes my website unique from others is that we search the internet for all the best deals and then upload them to our page. Users can then scroll through our page and when they see a deal that they like, they will be able to click on the link that will take them to the actually page with the product on it. This is where they will be able to actually buy the product. This is effective because people are constantly trying to search the web for the best deals. This usually takes lots of time and energy and many people end up getting frustrated and give up or give in to buying something that’s more than they were willing to pay. With my website, however, they will have all these deals collected together so that the customer doesn’t have to search. That’s our job—to search. The customer’s is to buy in a quick and easy way. My website can provide this for all shoppers.  </p>
