<p>I’ve always had a secret love for planning weddings so I 
decided to just make a website for it. <br>
The thing that makes my website 
unique from others is that we search the internet for all the <br>
best deals and then upload them to our 
page. You can then scroll through our page and when<br>
you see a deal you like, you'll be able to 
click on the link that will take you to the actual page<br>
with the product on it. This is where you will be 
able to actually buy the product. This is effective<br>
because people are constantly trying to search the web 
for the best deals. This usually takes lots <br>
of time and energy and many people end up getting frustrated 
and give up or give in to buying <br>
something that’s more than they were willing to pay. With my website, 
however, you will have<br>
all these deals collected together so that the you doesn’t have to search. <br><br>


Our job is to search, and yours is to shop. And who doesn't love shopping? :)
